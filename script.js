// Arithmetical Operators

// + => Only works with Number, if its values are different, then it concanate
// - => Difference between two Numbers
// * => Product
// "/" => Division
// % => "Module" uses the rest in a Division
// ++ => Incremment of 1 (if the symbol comes before the number, it display instantly the new value, but if used after, it refresh the value only after all the expressions)
// -- => Decrement of 1 (see incremment)

var num1 = 5;
var num2 = 3;

document.write(
    "Testing some expressions with " + num1 + " and " + num2 + "<br />" +
    num1 + num2

    In this example we are concanating strings and numbers, instead of 
)
