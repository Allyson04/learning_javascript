// DOM Manipulation

// getElementById() //Catches Element by his Id, remember that Id is intended to be used once
// getElementsByTagName() //Catches Elements by Tag Name, for example, links is uses <a>, images uses <img>, and go on
// getElementsByClassName() //Catches Elements by class name, like CSS
// getElementsByName() // Catches Elements by Name, like Name="radio_button"

// Considering that script is read before HTML, then we are using an script tag to use Javascript, the code is in index.html
